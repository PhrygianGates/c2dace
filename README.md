# C2DaCe

C2DaCe is an automatic tool that creates SDFGs from C source code. These can then be optimized using the DaCe framework, improving dataflow and discovering parallelism opportunities.

For more details, check our arXiv preprint: [Lifting C Semantics for Dataflow Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11879).

We are currently preparing a more "production-ready" release, which will be out soon! If you are interested in the original "research" code, look at the `old-c2dace` branch.
